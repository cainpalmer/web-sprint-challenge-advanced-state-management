# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
The context API makes prop drilling easier to use.

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
Actions pass data into the store, reducers are used to change state, and the store holds the state.

3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
Redux-thunk allows us to call action creators that return functions, which takes store methods to dispatch familiar actions.

4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
I like using Redux because it makes passing data through ends of the application very simple and fun.
